## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd linregapp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Standard Version
Run the standard Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Enhanced UI/UX Version (Recommended)
Run the enhanced version with modern UI:
```bash
streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Quick Start

1. **Home Page**: Get an overview and optionally load sample datasets
2. **Data Upload**: Upload your CSV file and select the target variable
3. **Preprocessing**: Configure data cleaning and feature engineering options
4. **Model Training**: Select models and train with automatic hyperparameter tuning
5. **Results & Insights**: Explore comprehensive visualizations and model performance
6. **Export & Deploy**: Save your best model and get deployment code
7. **Make Predictions**: Use your trained model for new predictions

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure your CSV has clean column names and consistent data types
2. **Target Variable**: Select a numerical column as your regression target
3. **Feature Selection**: The app automatically handles feature selection, but you can review feature importance
4. **Model Selection**: Start with all models to see which performs best on your data
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Enable this for better performance (takes longer)
